**Notice**
- Compatible with Wynncraft 2.1.1 and Festival of the Blizzard
- NEW WynnLODGrabber mod I created lets you download the LODs in game for Distant Horizons
- Doesn't include [Voices of Wynn](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/voices-of-wynn/files/all) 

**Changelog**
- Updated Sodium and Iris to full release, unfortunately the DH bug hasn't been fixed yet. [Please comment on the bug report to hopefully get it fixed sooner](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris/issues/2469)
- Added WynnLODGrabber
- Added WynnLimbo
- Added Resource Pack Overrides
- Updated Wynntils
- Updated Domix Wynncraft Overhaul
- Removed WynnAspects by default since it's complicated to setup and explain
- Fancy Menu now designed to work with vanilla Wynncraft resourcepack since WynnEdits Dark Theme hasn't updated


**Known Bugs**
- After leaving the main map area (like going into a dungeon) water stops generating in distant horizons LODs. You can reload shaders or play without shaders to fix this bug.
