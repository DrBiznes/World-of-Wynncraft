The initial public release of WoW modpack.

**Changes**
- Added more tooltips to menu buttons
- Updated WynnEdits dark theme
- Fixed menu clipping

**Notice**
- Only one version includes the Distant Horizons LODs, download the LODs separately below if you came from Modrinth.
- Doesn't include [Voices of Wynn](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/voices-of-wynn/files/5508422) 
- Shoulder Surfing Reloaded and [DSTC](https://modrinth.com/mod/dont-surf-through-cutscenes!) installed but disabled by default, enable it in the Modrinth launcher or by renaming the .jar file

**Known Bugs**
- Wynntils Un-Id predictions don't show with Legendary Tooltips installed
- Resource Loading occasionally fails. Just re-enable every resourcepack and make sure WynnEdits is above World of Wynn Resourcepack
